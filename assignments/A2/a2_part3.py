    This algorithm first initializes an empty GameTree. All ExploringPlayers will use this
    SAME GameTree object, which will be mutated over the course of the algorithm!
    Return this object.

    There are len(exploration_probabilities) games played, where at game i (starting at 0):
        - White is an ExploringPlayer (using the game tree) whose exploration probability
            is equal to exploration_probabilities[i]
        - Black is a RandomPlayer
        - AFTER the game, the move sequence from the game is inserted into the game tree,
          with a white win probability of 1.0 if White won the game, and 0.0 otherwise.

    Implementation note:
        - A NEW ExploringPlayer instance should be created for each loop iteration.
          However, each one should use the SAME GameTree object.
        - You should call run_game, NOT run_games, from a2_minichess. This is because you
          need more control over what happens after each game runs, which you can get by
          writing your own loop that calls run_game. However, you can base your loop on
          the implementation of run_games.
        - Note that run_game from a2_minichess returns both the winner and the move sequence
          after the game ends.
        - You may call print in this function to report progress made in each game.
        - Note that this function returns the final GameTree object. You can inspect the
          white_win_probability of its nodes, calculate its size, or and use it in a
          RandomTreePlayer or GreedyTreePlayer to see how they do with it.
